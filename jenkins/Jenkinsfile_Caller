@Library('lib') _
// Tells Jenkins to load the shared library named 'lib' before executing pipeline
// @Library('tsc@somebranch')
// _ means to load the library but not assign it to a variable
// Shared libraries help you reuse pipeline code across multiple Jenkinsfiles
// The library must be defined in the 'Jenkins Global Shared Libraries' or loaded dynamically.

LIBPipeline {} 
// LIBPipeline {} - is calling a function or class from the library 'lib'
// Likely that LIBPipeline is a custom step inside the shared library

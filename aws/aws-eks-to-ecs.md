# AWS EKS to ECS Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive migration strategy from Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). The migration involves transitioning from Kubernetes-based orchestration to AWS-native container management, requiring careful planning to minimize downtime and ensure application reliability.

## 1. Pre-Migration Assessment

### 1.1 Current State Analysis
- **Inventory existing EKS clusters** and their configurations
- **Document all running workloads**, including:
  - Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets
  - Services and Ingress configurations
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets
  - Persistent Volume Claims
  - Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- **Analyze resource requirements** (CPU, memory, storage)
- **Review networking configurations** (VPCs, subnets, security groups)
- **Document current monitoring and logging setup**
- **Identify dependencies** between services and external systems

### 1.2 ECS Architecture Decision
Choose between ECS deployment options:
- **ECS with EC2 launch type**: More control over underlying infrastructure
- **ECS with Fargate launch type**: Serverless container management
- **Hybrid approach**: Mix of both based on workload requirements

### 1.3 Gap Analysis
Document differences between EKS and ECS:
- **Orchestration paradigms**: Kubernetes pods vs ECS tasks
- **Service discovery**: Kubernetes DNS vs AWS Service Discovery
- **Load balancing**: Ingress controllers vs Application Load Balancers
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes vs EFS/EBS integration
- **Configuration management**: ConfigMaps/Secrets vs Parameter Store/Secrets Manager

## 2. Migration Strategy

### 2.1 Migration Approach
**Recommended**: Blue-Green deployment with gradual traffic shifting
- Maintain EKS environment as "blue" (current)
- Build ECS environment as "green" (target)
- Gradually shift traffic from blue to green
- Keep blue environment as rollback option

### 2.2 Migration Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)
- Create ECS clusters in target AWS regions
- Set up VPC, subnets, and security groups
- Configure IAM roles and policies for ECS
- Set up Application Load Balancers
- Implement AWS Service Discovery
- Configure logging with CloudWatch
- Set up monitoring with CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray

#### Phase 2: Application Transformation (Week 2-4)
- Convert Kubernetes manifests to ECS task definitions
- Transform Docker images if necessary
- Migrate configuration data to Parameter Store/Secrets Manager
- Set up ECS services with appropriate scaling policies
- Configure health checks and deployment strategies
- Test individual services in isolation

#### Phase 3: Data Migration (Week 4-5)
- Plan database migration strategy
- Migrate persistent data from EKS persistent volumes to EFS/EBS
- Set up data replication between environments
- Validate data integrity and consistency

#### Phase 4: Integration Testing (Week 5-6)
- Deploy full application stack in ECS
- Conduct end-to-end testing
- Performance testing and optimization
- Security testing and compliance validation
- Load testing to ensure scalability

#### Phase 5: Production Cutover (Week 7-8)
- Implement traffic splitting at load balancer level
- Gradually increase traffic to ECS environment
- Monitor application performance and errors
- Complete traffic cutover
- Decommission EKS resources after validation period

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Container Image Migration
```bash
# Example: Tag and push existing images to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
docker tag my-app:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
```

### 3.2 Task Definition Conversion
Transform Kubernetes Deployments to ECS Task Definitions:

**Kubernetes Deployment Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-app
        image: my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
```

**ECS Task Definition Equivalent:**
```json
{
  "family": "web-app",
  "taskRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::account:role/ecsTaskRole",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "web-app",
      "image": "account.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest",
      "memory": 256,
      "cpu": 256,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 8080,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
